# Price Calculator 

You are calculating the final price for a product after discount and tax. The discount is applied first, and tax is calculated on the discounted price.

Write these functions:
- `calculateDiscount(price, discountPercent)` should return the discount amount.
- `calculateTax(priceAfterDiscount, taxPercent)` should return the tax amount.
- `calculateFinalPrice(price, discountPercent, taxPercent)` should subtract the discount, add tax, and return the final price.
- `createPriceSummary(price, discountPercent, taxPercent)` should return an object with price, discount, tax, and finalPrice.

Sample checks:
console.log(createPriceSummary(100, 20, 10));
console.log(createPriceSummary(200, 25, 5));
console.log(createPriceSummary(50, 0, 10));

Expected outputs: 
{ price: 100, discount: 20, tax: 8, finalPrice: 88 }
{ price: 200, discount: 50, tax: 7.5, finalPrice: 157.5 }
{ price: 50, discount: 0, tax: 5, finalPrice: 55 }
